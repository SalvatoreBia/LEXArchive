Planet Name:Planet name most commonly used in the literature
Host Name:Stellar name most commonly used in the literature
Default Parameter Set:Boolean flag indicating whether given set of planet parameters has been selected as default (1=yes, 0=no)
Number of Stars:Number of stars in the planetary system
Number of Planets:Number of confirmed planets in the planetary system
Discovery Method:Method by which the planet was first identified
Discovery Year:Year the planet was discovered
Discovery Facility:Name of facility of planet discovery observations
Solution Type:Disposition of planet according to given planet parameter set
Controversial Flag:Flag indicating whether the confirmation status of a planet has been questioned in the published literature (1=yes, 0=no)
Planetary Parameter Reference:Reference of publication used for given planet parameter set
Orbital Period [days]:Time the planet takes to make a complete orbit around the host star or system
Orbit Semi-Major Axis [au]:The longest radius of an elliptic orbit, or, for exoplanets detected via gravitational microlensing or direct imaging, the projected separation in the plane of the sky
Planet Radius [Earth Radius]:Length of a line segment from the center of the planet to its surface, measured in units of radius of the Earth
Planet Radius [Jupiter Radius]:Length of a line segment from the center of the planet to its surface, measured in units of radius of Jupiter
Planet Mass or Mass*sin(i) [Earth Mass]:Best planet mass estimate available, in order of preference: Mass, M*sin(i)/sin(i), or M*sin(i), depending on availability, and measured in Earth masses
Planet Mass or Mass*sin(i) [Jupiter Mass]:Best planet mass estimate available, in order of preference: Mass, M*sin(i)/sin(i), or M*sin(i), depending on availability, and measured in Jupiter masses
Planet Mass or Mass*sin(i) Provenance:Provenance of the measurement of the best mass. Options are: Mass, M*sin(i)/sin(i), and M*sini
Eccentricity:Amount by which the orbit of the planet deviates from a perfect circle
Insolation Flux [Earth Flux]:Insolation flux is another way to give the equilibrium temperature. It's given in units relative to those measured for the Earth from the Sun.
Equilibrium Temperature [K]:The equilibrium temperature of the planet as modeled by a black body heated only by its host star, or for directly imaged planets, the effective temperature of the planet required to match the measured luminosity if the planet were a black body
Data show Transit Timing Variations:Flag indicating if the planet orbit exhibits transit timing variations from another planet in the system (1=yes, 0=no).  NOTE: Non-transiting planets discovered via the transit timing variations of another planet in the system will not have their TTV flag set, since they do not themselves demonstrate TTVs.
Stellar Parameter Reference:Reference of publication used for given stellar parameter set
Spectral Type:Classification of the star based on their spectral characteristics following the Morgan-Keenan system
Stellar Effective Temperature [K]:Temperature of the star as modeled by a black body emitting the same total amount of electromagnetic radiation
Stellar Radius [Solar Radius]:Length of a line segment from the center of the star to its surface, measured in units of radius of the Sun
Stellar Mass [Solar Mass]:Amount of matter contained in the star, measured in units of masses of the Sun
Stellar Metallicity [dex]:Measurement of the metal content of the photosphere of the star as compared to the hydrogen content
Stellar Metallicity Ratio:Ratio for the Metallicity Value ([Fe/H] denotes iron abundance, [M/H] refers to a general metal content)
Stellar Surface Gravity [log10(cm/s**2)]:Gravitational acceleration experienced at the stellar surface
System Parameter Reference:Reference of publication used for given system parameter set
RA [sexagesimal]:Right Ascension of the planetary system in sexagesimal format
Dec [sexagesimal]:Declination of the planetary system in sexagesimal notation
Distance [pc]:Distance to the planetary system in units of parsecs
V (Johnson) Magnitude:Brightness of the host star as measured using the V (Johnson) band in units of magnitudes
Ks (2MASS) Magnitude:Brightness of the host star as measured using the K (2MASS) band in units of magnitudes
Gaia Magnitude:Brightness of the host star as measuring using the Gaia band in units of magnitudes. Objects matched to Gaia using the Hipparcos or 2MASS IDs provided in Gaia DR2.
