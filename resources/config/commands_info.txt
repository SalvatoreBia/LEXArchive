info:This helps you understand how to use the bot's commands if you're using it for the first time. You can input one or more commands separated by whitespaces. Example: /info count show
count:Count how many rows there are in the 'Planetary Systems' table, where for each planet can be multiple records since more than one research group can provide the data observed.
pcount:Count how many rows there are in the 'Planetary Systems Composite Data' table, where each row represent a unique planet.
discin:Count how many rows there are in 'Planetary Systems Composite Data' where the 'Discovery Year' matches your input.
search:Displays a list of planet in the database. You can filter the search by providing an input such as a letter or the entire planet name. If an empty string is provided, the command will display the planets in alphabetical order.
table:Returns an HTML file displaying all records retrieved in 'Planetary Systems' table by providing an input such as a letter or the entire planet name. By default the commands return 20 rows at most, since the file would take more time to be processed.
plot:Returns a photo plotting a certain planet parameter. The currently field supported by the command are *emass*(mass measured in earth masses), *jmass*(mass measured in jupiter masses), *erad*(radius measured in earth radius), *jrad*(radius measured in jupiter radius), *sgrav*(stellar surface gravity), *srad*(stellar radius measured in solar radius), *smass*(stellar mass measured in solar masses)
fields:Displays all the fields used in the database. It's useful when you want to know how the data is structured. You can make inline queries searching for a specific fields in case you need to know what a field actually means.
locate:Returns a photo of a piece of sky based on the coordinates of the planet you searched, pointing at the direction where it's located. *NOTE*: to use this command properly, you need to enter the entire planet name, whitespaces and lowercase allowed.
show:Returns a 3D image of the celestial body you searched. If you're looking for a star, use the option *-s*. *NOTE*: to use this command properly, you need to enter the entire planet name, whitespaces and lowercase allowed.
random:??????
near:Returns the 3 (if available) nearest planets to the earth, measuring the distance in parsecs. *NOTE*: 1 parsec is 3,086*10^16 meters.
far:Returns the 3 (if available) farthest planets to the earth, measuring the distance in parsecs. *NOTE*: 1 parsec is 3,086*10^16 meters.
hab:Returns an habitability index estimated calculating common factors like habitable zone, gravity, and so on. You can use the option *-m* if you want to calculate on multiple records (for each research group). *NOTE*: to use this command properly, you need to enter the entire planet name, whitespaces and lowercase allowed.
sub:Subscribe for daily updates at a specific time. If you're subscribed and you want to change the time, just run the command again with the new one. Example: /sub 08:30 to receive updates every day at 08:30.
unsub:Unsubscribe from daily updates.
report:Submit a message to report any problems using the bot. Example: /report The command /count is not working properly.
shwz:Displays the schwarzschild radius of a celestial body: This is the size a star or planet would have to shrink to become a black hole. If you squash it smaller than this radius, it turns into a black hole.
habzone:Displays the inner and outer edges of the habitable zone, the zone were a planet must reside in to possibly have liquid water.
